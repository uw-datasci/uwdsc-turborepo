### Database Connection Improvements

- **Migration to postgres.js**: Migrated from `pg` (node-postgres) to `postgres.js` for better serverless and Supabase Transaction Pooler compatibility
- **Connection Timeout Fix**: Resolved database connection timeout issues by disabling prepared statements (`prepare: false`) for Supabase Transaction Pooler (port 6543)
- **Optimized Configuration**: 
  - Single connection per serverless function (`max: 1`)
  - 10-second idle timeout for efficient resource usage
  - 10-second connection timeout for faster failure detection
  - 30-minute max connection lifetime
- **Tagged Template Queries**: Improved SQL query syntax with tagged template literals for better type safety and automatic escaping
- **Simplified Transaction Handling**: Cleaner transaction API using `sql.begin()` instead of manual connection pool management
