# Application & Review System

Complete guide to the CxC application submission and admin review system.

## Overview

The CxC application system includes:
- Multi-step application form with validation
- Team member selection
- Resume upload with secure storage
- Form state persistence across sessions
- Admin review interface with scoring system

## Application Flow

### Form Structure

The application is divided into **6 main steps** (desktop view) and **11 pages** (mobile view):

#### Step 1: Your Info
- **Contact Info** - Phone number and Discord username
- **About You** - T-shirt size, dietary restrictions, age, country
- **Optional Demographics** - Gender and ethnicity (optional)

#### Step 2: Your Experience
- **Education** - University, program, year of study
- **Hackathon Experience** - Prior experience level, number of hackathons attended
- **Links & Documents** - GitHub, LinkedIn, website, resume upload

#### Step 3: Application Questions
- **Question 1** - Technical project description (challenges, learnings)
- **Question 2** - Creative haiku submission

#### Step 4: Team Members (Optional)
- Search and select up to 3 team members
- Only users with existing accounts appear in search

#### Step 5: MLH Requirements
- MLH Code of Conduct agreement (required)
- Information sharing authorization (required)
- Marketing email opt-in (optional)

#### Step 6: Review & Submit
- Review all submitted information
- View selected team members with names
- Preview uploaded resume
- Submit final application

### Form State Persistence

**Automatic Progress Saving**
- Current step/page saved to localStorage
- Returns to last position on page reload
- Prevents losing progress from browser crashes

**Field-Level Autosave**
- All form fields automatically save to localStorage as you type
- Data persists across page refreshes
- Restored when returning to the application
- Cleared upon successful submission

**Supported Fields**
- Text inputs (name, email, phone, Discord)
- Select dropdowns (university, program, year, etc.)
- Text areas (application questions)
- Checkboxes (MLH agreements)
- File uploads (resume filename tracked)
- Team member selections

### Team Member Selection

**How It Works**
1. Click the search input in the "Team Members" step
2. Search by name or email address
3. Select users from the dropdown (max 3)
4. Team members displayed as removable tags
5. Names shown in review section if available

**API Integration**
```typescript
// Fetch all registered users
const { emails } = await getUserEmails();

// emails structure:
// [
//   { id: "uuid", email: "user@example.com", display_name: "John Doe" },
//   ...
// ]
```

**Team Member Display**
- Shows both name and email if name is available
- Falls back to email only if name not set
- Team members shown in application review
- Visible to reviewers during admin review

### Resume Upload

**Upload Process**
1. Select PDF, DOC, or DOCX file (max 10 MB)
2. File uploaded immediately upon selection
3. Validation runs before upload:
   - File size check (max 10 MB)
   - File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
4. Previous resume automatically replaced
5. Filename displayed in form after upload

**Storage & Security**
- Resumes stored in private Supabase bucket
- Access requires signed URLs (1-hour expiration)
- Ownership verified before generating URLs
- Files organized by user ID: `{userId}/{filename}`

**API Usage**
```typescript
// Upload resume
await uploadResume(file);

// Get current resume
const { resume, url, key } = await getResume();
// resume: { name: "resume.pdf", ... }
// url: "https://...signed-url..."
// key: "userId/resume.pdf"
```

### Application Submission

**Submission Process**
1. Complete all required fields in steps 1-5
2. Review information in step 6
3. Click "Submit Application" button
4. Backend validates all data
5. Application status changed to "submitted"
6. LocalStorage cleared automatically
7. Redirected to "Submitted" confirmation page

**Submission Protection**
- Cannot edit application after submission
- Attempting to access `/apply` redirects to "Submitted" page
- Application data locked in database

## Admin Review System

### Review Assignment

**Fair Assignment Algorithm**
- Returns application with **least number of reviews**
- Excludes applications already reviewed by requesting admin
- Ties broken **lexicographically by application ID**
- Ensures even distribution of reviews across applications

**API Endpoint**
```typescript
GET /api/applications/random

// Returns:
{
  application: {
    id: "app-uuid",
    profile_id: "user-uuid",
    email: "applicant@example.com",
    resume_url: "https://...signed-url...",
    team_members_with_names: [
      { email: "teammate@example.com", display_name: "Jane Smith" }
    ],
    // ... all application fields ...
  }
}
```

### Review Interface

**Accessing the Review Page**
- Navigate to `/review` (admin users only)
- Non-admin users automatically redirected to home
- Role verification happens in middleware

**Review Components**

1. **Basic Information Card**
   - Contact details (email, phone, Discord)
   - Personal info (t-shirt size, dietary restrictions, gender, ethnicity)
   - Education (university, program, year)
   - Hackathon experience
   - Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, website)
   - Resume link (opens in new tab with signed URL)
   - Team members with names and emails
   - **Score: 1-10** for overall basic information quality

2. **Question 1 Card**
   - Displays technical project response
   - Full text with preserved formatting
   - **Score: 1-10** for technical depth and clarity

3. **Question 2 Card**
   - Displays haiku submission
   - Full text with preserved formatting
   - **Score: 1-10** for creativity and following haiku format

**Scoring Guidelines**
- All scores required (1-10 scale)
- Cannot submit until all categories scored
- Validation prevents duplicate reviews
- Real-time error feedback

### Review Submission

**Submit Review Process**
```typescript
// Client-side submission
await submitReview({
  application_id: "app-uuid",
  basic_info_score: 8,
  q1_score: 7,
  q2_score: 9
});

// Response:
{
  success: true,
  message: "Review saved successfully",
  review: { id: "review-uuid", ... },
  total_reviews: 42  // Total reviews by this reviewer
}
```

**Server-Side Validation**
- Scores must be numbers between 1-10
- All three scores required
- Duplicate review check (same reviewer + application)
- Admin role verification
- Database transaction ensures consistency

**After Submission**
- Success message displayed
- Option to review another application
- "Get New Application" button fetches next review

### Review Storage

**Database Schema**
```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  application_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES applications(id),
  reviewer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(id),
  basic_info_score INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (basic_info_score >= 1 AND basic_info_score <= 10),
  q1_score INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (q1_score >= 1 AND q1_score <= 10),
  q2_score INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (q2_score >= 1 AND q2_score <= 10),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(application_id, reviewer_id)  -- Prevent duplicate reviews
);
```

**Tracking**
- Each review linked to specific application and reviewer
- Timestamp records when review submitted
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate reviews
- Can query total reviews by application or reviewer

```typescript
import { useFormFieldPersistence } from "@/hooks/useFormFieldPersistence";

// In your form component:
function MyFormSection({ form }: { form: UseFormReturn<AppFormValues> }) {
  // Persist individual fields
  useFormFieldPersistence(form, "phone");
  useFormFieldPersistence(form, "discord");
  useFormFieldPersistence(form, "university_name");
  
  // Custom storage key (optional)
  useFormFieldPersistence(form, "cxc_q1", "q1_save");
  
  // ... render form
}
```

**Features**
- Automatically saves on field change
- Restores from localStorage on mount
- Handles form.reset() correctly
- Works with text inputs, selects, checkboxes, arrays
- Special handling for undefined/empty values
- Cleared on application submission

## Best Practices

### Application Form

**Do:**
- Validate all inputs before allowing step progression
- Save progress frequently to localStorage
- Provide clear error messages
- Allow users to go back and edit previous steps
- Show progress indicator (step numbers)

**Don't:**
- Submit incomplete applications
- Allow editing after submission
- Store sensitive data in localStorage indefinitely
- Skip validation on form submission

### Resume Handling

**Do:**
- Validate file size and type client-side
- Show upload progress/feedback
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Use signed URLs for private access
- Set appropriate URL expiration times

**Don't:**
- Store resumes in public buckets
- Allow arbitrary file types
- Keep expired signed URLs
- Skip virus scanning (in production)

### Review System

**Do:**
- Verify admin role before showing review UI
- Prevent duplicate reviews at database level
- Track review counts for analytics
- Provide clear scoring criteria
- Show all relevant application information

**Don't:**
- Allow non-admins to access review endpoints
- Skip validation of review scores
- Allow reviews of already-reviewed applications
- Expose applicant personally identifiable information unnecessarily

## Troubleshooting

### Form State Not Persisting
1. Check browser localStorage is enabled
2. Verify `useFormFieldPersistence` hook is called
3. Check for JavaScript errors in console
4. Clear localStorage and try again: `localStorage.clear()`

### Resume Upload Fails
1. Check file size (max 10 MB)
2. Verify file type (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
3. Check network connection
4. Verify Supabase storage configuration
5. Check bucket permissions

### Review Page Access Denied
1. Verify user has admin role in database
2. Check profile table: `SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE id = 'user-id'`
3. Verify middleware is running correctly
4. Check authentication status

### Team Member Not Appearing in Search
1. Verify the user has created an account
2. Check the user's email is confirmed
3. Verify the user exists in auth.users table
4. Check for typos in search query
